The Chaser Game
=============
The Chaser Game is a simple, LAN-based multiplayer game. It is designed to follow the core principles of .io games:
 - Have the player be able to hop right into a game with one click. 
 - Be super simple to learn, but difficult to master. 
 - Allow the player to "scale" their authority in-game. For example, in agar.io you grow a lot bigger and scarier the more you eat.
 - Either be competitive or cooperative.

 ## Game Mechanics
 - Increase your score by staying alive or killing other players with your gun-like weapon.
 - The game contains three powerups: Speed, which increases your speed for a short time; Camouflage, which greatly reduces your visibility for a short time;
 and Ammo, which gives you ammunition for your weapon.
 - Speed and Camouflage each last for 3 seconds. Speed doubles movement speed while Camouflage simply draws your character with a color hue very similar to that of the ground.
 - Bullets will travel at double the speed of a non-Speed-buffed player and will bounce off walls for their lifetime of 10 seconds.
